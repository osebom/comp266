                <p>
                    The Top Gun Naval Fighter Weapons School is where the best of the best train to refine their elite flying skills. When hotshot fighter pilot Maverick (Tom Cruise) is sent to the school, his reckless attitude and cocky demeanor put him at odds with the other pilots, especially the cool and collected Iceman (Val Kilmer). But Maverick isn't only competing to be the top fighter pilot, he's also fighting for the attention of his beautiful flight instructor, Charlotte Blackwood (Kelly McGillis).

        <h2>Trivia</h2>
        <div class="trivia">
            <ul>
                <li>Tom Cruise met with Ridley Scott to see if he would be interested in directing this movie, as his brother, Tony Scott, 
                    had directed the original film. Scott, who had previously directed Cruise in Legend (1985), politely declined. 
                    He said that fast-paced, high-octane action movies like this were not really his style. 
                    However, he did draw up a list of directors he thought would be better candidates for Cruise.
                </li>
                <li>The actors playing pilots not only had to film themselves, turning the camera on and off, they also had to touch up their own makeup, 
                    adjust their lighting, and handle their own sound. 
                    Sometimes the director had to wait on the ground for hours for the actors to return with the footage. 
                </li>
                <li>The film is dedicated to the memory of original Top Gun (1986) director Tony Scott, 
                    who died by suicide on August 19, 2012 at the age of 68. 
                    He had been developing his own version of a sequel before his death.
